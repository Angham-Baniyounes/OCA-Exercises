                <p>
                    known as the Tiny Turtle Pokémon, is turtle Pokémon with large eyes and chubby cheeks, capable of moving either on two feet or on all fours. Their skin is a light blue, and they possess a long, curled tail. "Loves Nuts." When feeling threatened, Squirtle withdraws their limbs into their brown-orange shells and spray water from their mouth with great force, either to attack their opponent or merely to intimidate it. If attacked anyway, their shells are resilient and provide excellent protection. It shelters itself in its shell, then strikes back with spouts of water at every opportunity.
